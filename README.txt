This project aims to test some basic functions for a PIC18f45K80 mpu mounted on an EasyPIC v7
Code is written in MPLABX v6.00 and uses Makefile to build.

The git was initially created in git software (FORK) on local machine. Then, a git with the same name as the project 
i.e., the folder name, was created on github.com and then the local repository was connected to the github repository
by copying the github repository remote URL and typing the following commands in the terminal

$ git remote add origin  <REMOTE_URL> 
# Sets the new remote
$ git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL
